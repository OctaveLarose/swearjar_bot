# swearjar_bot
Basic Discord bot made using the discord.py API wrapper

As the name implies, it's a swear jar, where everytime a user says a swear word, a dollar gets automatically added in. Users are tracked.

Made for fun as my very first Python project. Not to be taken seriously, if anything, the goal is to make the jar as full as possible.

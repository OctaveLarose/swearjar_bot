# swearjar_bot
Basic Discord bot made using the discord.py API wrapper

As the name implies, it's a swear jar, where everytime a user says a swear word, a dollar gets automatically added in. Users are tracked.
Made for fun by a Python rookie. Obviously not to be taken seriously, if anything, the goal is to make the jar as full as possible.
